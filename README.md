Spongy IRC Client for Chrome
===================

This is a Chrome client for the
[Spongy IRC Bouncer Thing](https://github.com/nealey/spongy).

The user interface is based heavily on
[circ](https://github.com/flackr/circ).
And when I say "heavily" here,
I mean that I lifted it almost verbatim and touched only what was required to have it work with my JavaScript.

You probably want to install this from the Chrome Store.
I'll put a link to that when I have one.
